       " 'dct:description': 'Mid-2017 population estimates for Northern Ireland were published on 28 June 2018. Migration is one of the components of population change; its estimates are provided to enable understanding of the mid-year population estimates and to inform comment. \\n\\nNotes:\\n1. The estimates are produced using a variety of data sources and statistical models.  Therefore small estimates should not be taken to refer to particular individuals.\\n2. The migration element of the components of change have been largely derived from a data source which is known to be deficient in recording young adult males and outflows from Northern Ireland. Therefore the estimates are subject to adjustment to account for this and, while deemed acceptable for their use, will not provide definitive numbers of the population in the reported groups/areas. Further information is available in the Limitations section of the statistical bulletin:\\nhttps://www.nisra.gov.uk/sites/nisra.gov.uk/files/publications/MYE17-Bulletin.pdf\\n\\nTime Period\\nEstimates are provided for mid-2001 to mid-2017\\n\\nMethodology\\nThe migration estimates takes into account flows between Northern Ireland and (i) the rest of the UK, and (ii) the rest of the world.  Net migration is the difference between in migration and out migration. Further information is available at:\\nhttps://www.nisra.gov.uk/sites/nisra.gov.uk/files/publications/Methodology-2017.pdf\\n\\nGeographic Referencing\\nPopulation Estimates are based on a large number of secondary datasets. Where the full address was available, the Pointer Address database was used to allocate a unique property reference number (UPRN) and geo-spatial co-ordinates to each home address. These can then be used to map the address to particular geographies. Where it was not possible to assign a unique property reference number to an address using the Pointer database, or where the secondary dataset contained only postcode information, the Central Postcode Directory was used to map home address postcodes to higher geographies. A small proportion of records with unknown geography were apportioned based on the spatial characteristics of known records. \\n\\nFurther Information\\nThe next mid-year estimates will be released in June 2019\\nhttps://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/population/mid-year-population-estimates'}"
